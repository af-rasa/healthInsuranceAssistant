Apply comprehensive date recognition algorithms to handle diverse input formats including DD/MM/YYYY, MM-DD-YY, Month Day Year, and any other variations users might provide. When a non-compliant format is detected, convert it to YYYY-MM-DD and simultaneously update the dob_input slot with this standardized value to ensure consistent downstream processing. Provide clear feedback to users when their date has been reformatted for system compatibility."
